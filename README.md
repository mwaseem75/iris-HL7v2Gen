### Generate HL7 Message
The core functionality of IRIS-HL7v2Gen is its ability to dynamically generate HL7 test messages. Users can select from a list of 184 message types, ranging from ADT (Admit, Discharge, Transfer) messages to ORM (Order Message) and ORU (Observation Result) messages. This dynamic message generation allows developers and testers to simulate a wide array of healthcare data exchanges and test their integrations.

The applicationâ€™s interface is designed for simplicity, allowing users to select a message type from a dropdown list, click a button, and immediately generate a test message. This feature is valuable for quickly creating realistic data exchanges that can be used to test systems, troubleshoot errors, and ensure compliance with HL7 standards.

Select a message type from the dropdown list and click the "Generate Test Message" button

### Explore the Structure of the Message
HL7 messages can be complex, containing multiple segments, fields, and components. Understanding the structure of these messages is key to ensuring that data is transmitted accurately. IRIS-HL7v2Gen provides an intuitive feature that allows users to explore the structure of the generated message. This feature visualizes the hierarchical structure of the HL7 message, making it easier to understand how different parts of the message relate to each other.

By providing this level of insight, the application helps users identify any structural issues within the message and make necessary adjustments before transmission.

Upon selecting the Message Type, the application will construct the message structure based on HL7 specifications.

### Value Set Visualization
This feature enhances message profiling by displaying field value sets. It allows users to view predefined sets of allowable coded values for each field within the message profile, ensuring that data is consistent and standardized according to HL7 v2 specifications. By binding fields to specific value sets, the application helps users create precise, compliant message definitions, reducing optionality and improving interoperability between healthcare systems.

### Validate HL7 Message
Once a test message has been generated, the application provides a built-in message validation feature. Validating HL7 messages is crucial to ensure they conform to the HL7 standards, preventing issues during real-world exchanges. 
Click the "Validate Message" button to validate the message

### Generate a Test Message by Invoking a Class Method
Connect to the IRIS Terminal, and execute the GenMessage function of the dc.HL7v2Gen class, and pass the desired HL7 message type
```
set mes = ##class(dc.HL7v2Gen).GenMessage("ADT_A01")
write mes
```
